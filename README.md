# Infinibattle 2019 Bot "Angsthaas"

Basic "fearful" bot for the 2019 edition of Infinibattle.

## Description

Time pressure prevented me from writing a full-blown competitive bot.
However, similar to last year, I did make at least _some_ bot: "Meedoen is belangrijker dan winnen!"

The strategy for this bot is to "flee" from the opponent, sending only a handful of ships to other planets, preferring those that are furthest from the enemy.
Unsurprisingly, this "Angsthaas" bot will loose most matches, even against the starter bots.
